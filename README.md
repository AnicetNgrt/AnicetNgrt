# About me
### Looking for a 3+ months fullstack programmer internship starting in April 2021

My name is Anicet. I'm a 19 year old IT student in Paris France.

Since childhood I love to come with new ideas and to work on my very own creative projects.

My two main skills are programming and art. But I often hear I'm good at managing teams,
getting the work done, teaching complex topics and writing about stuff.

### What kind of work am I interested in ?

I believe the tools one work with do not matter as much as the goal, spirit and impact of the project.
I'm very open minded with tech stacks.

But if you want to know, here are my favorite languages and techs:
- Languages
  - JS & TS
  - Python
  - Java
  - C & C++
  - Rust is super cool but I'm no expert
- Techs
  - Front
    - Godot Engine
    - React
    - Twig / Ejs
    - Vanilla web (html/CSS)
  - Server
    - Node.js
    - Java
    - PHP (Symfony)
  - DB (very much not a deal breaker to me)
    - MySQL
    - MongoDB

As for the kind of projects I'm most interested in, anything creative (Interactive Art, games), anything positive (Charity, NGOs),
anything challenging and new (Machine learning, blockchain (note I only know some theory, never tried to use those. I am not a
blind enthusiast)).
