My name is Anicet. I'm a 19 year old IT student in Paris France.
Since childhood I love to come with new ideas and to work on my very own creative projects.
My two main skills are programming and art. But I often hear I'm good at managing teams,
getting the work done, teaching complex topics and writing about stuff.
