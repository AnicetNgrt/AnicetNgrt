# About me

My name is Anicet. I'm a 19 year old IT student in "IUT de Paris" France.

Since childhood I come up with new ideas and work on my very own creative projects.

My two main skills are programming and art. But I often hear I'm good at leading and organizing teams and projects,
getting the work done, teaching complex topics and writing about stuff.
