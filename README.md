# About me
### Looking for a 3+ months fullstack programmer internship starting in April 2021

My name is Anicet. I'm a 19 year old IT student in Paris France.

Since childhood I love to come with new ideas and to work on my very own creative projects.

My two main skills are programming and art. But I often hear I'm good at managing teams,
getting the work done, teaching complex topics and writing about stuff.

### What kind of tech am I interested in ?

I believe the tools we use do not matter as much as the final product.
I'm very open minded with tech stacks.

But if you want to know, here are my favorite languages and techs:

**Languages**: JS & TS, Python, Java, C & C++, Rust (but I'm no expert)

**Front**: Godot Engine (for games), React, Templating engines, Vanilla web (html/CSS)

**Server**: Node.js (Rest, real time), Java (TCP), PHP (MVC with Symfony)

**DB**: MySQL, MongoDB

If you've got any project to talk to me about, do not hesitate!
